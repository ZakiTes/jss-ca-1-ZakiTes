Meme-central
Meme-central is a meme overview website that fetches memes from an API and populates a table with 20 memes. Each meme has its own details page, and there's a button in the table that is hidden when the user is not logged in but visible when a user is logged in. Clicking this button redirects the logged-in user to the details page of the clicked meme.
